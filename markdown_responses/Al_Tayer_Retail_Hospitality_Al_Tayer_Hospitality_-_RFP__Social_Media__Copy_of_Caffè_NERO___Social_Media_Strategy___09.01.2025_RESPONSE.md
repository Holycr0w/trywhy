# Costa Coffee

Coffee house brand owned by the Coca Cola company:

Coca-Cola Company; which owns Costa Coffee, operates a factory in the illegal Israeli settlement of Atarot; which is built in Occupied Palestine.

Under Mr Narasimhan's leadership, Starbucks struggled with declining sales, partly attributed to a broader consumer backlash due to the corporation's alleged links to Israel. This resulted in growing calls for a boycott of American coffee houses across the Middle East and South Asia.

# Why Starbucks is being boycotted
