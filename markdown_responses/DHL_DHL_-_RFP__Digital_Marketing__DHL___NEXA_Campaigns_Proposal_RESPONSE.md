# DHL Digital Marketing Campaign Proposal

DHL is looking to launch a targeted digital marketing campaign to enhance brand awareness, drive website traffic, and generate high-quality leads across B2B and B2C segments. The goal is to maximize engagement and optimize ROI through a data-driven, performance-focused strategy spanning multiple platforms.

In today’s competitive logistics landscape, cutting through the noise requires precise audience targeting and engaging content that speaks directly to business decision-makers and frequent shippers. With evolving consumer behavior and increased competition, DHL needs a structured digital approach that positions it as the preferred choice for international shipping, freight forwarding, and express delivery services.

To achieve this, we will leverage Google Search, Performance Max, META, LinkedIn, TikTok, and Snapchat to execute high-impact campaigns. Our strategy includes:

- Search & intent-driven marketing to capture high-value leads actively searching for logistics solutions.
- Engagement campaigns to build brand recognition and trust among businesses and frequent shippers.
- Retargeting & conversion optimization to maximize lead generation and customer acquisition.

As performance marketing specialists, we bring expertise in multi-platform digital strategy, data analytics, and ROI-driven execution. By employing industry best practices, leveraging insights, and focusing on measurable results, we will deliver a high-impact campaign that aligns with DHL’s business objectives.

Through the following sections, we will outline our proposed strategy, execution framework, and performance measurement approach to ensure optimal campaign success.
                                                                                          Dr

                                                                                  DHL '

# INCREASE WEBSITE TRAFFIC

# OBJECTIVES

Drive high-intent users to DHL’s business solutions pages through targeted search and performance (B2B) campaigns.

Optimize for decision-makers and businesses seeking freight, logistics, and shipping services.

# GENERATE HIGH-QUALITY CONVERSIONS

Leverage Google Search, Performance Max, and LinkedIn Ads to capture and convert business leads.

Use precise audience targeting (job titles, industries, and behaviors) to drive form submissions and inquiries.
# INCREASE BRAND AWARENESS

Drive engagement

Encourage interactions through engaging creatives, video content, and interactive formats.

Position DHL as the preferred shipping partner by showcasing reliable and fast delivery solutions.

Use META, TikTok, Snapchat & Pmax for maximum reach and visibility.

# BOOST CONVERSIONS

Optimize retargeting and behavioral targeting to convert high-intent users into shipping customers.

Use limited-time offers, urgency messaging, and seamless booking experiences to maximize conversions.
# Our team has conducted a comprehensive audit of DHL’s current advertising strategy

assessing its performance in comparison to key competitors. This analysis is based on traffic insights, engagement metrics, and industry benchmarks.

- By evaluating DHL’s ads alongside competitors, we aim to identify opportunities for optimization and areas for strategic advantage. This comparison helps us understand how DHL’s digital presence aligns with market trends and where refinements can drive better engagement, visibility, and conversion.
- This approach ensures that our recommendations are data-driven, competitive, and aligned with industry best practices, ultimately helping DHL enhance its ad performance and market positioning.

1. Consistent Branding: Ad headlines and descriptions frequently mention DHL and “Fulfillment,” reinforcing brand recognition.
2. Clear Service Focus: Emphasis on e-commerce, European fulfillment, and logistics solutions shows DHL’s expertise and range.
3. Multiple Ad Variations: Different headlines and ad copies target varied customer pain points (e.g., “Fulfillment Network,” “Logistics in Europe,” “E-commerce Solutions”).
4. Relevant Keywords: Terms like “Fulfillment,” “E-commerce,” and “Logistics” align with what potential customers might search for.

# BRAND ADS ANALYSIS

PLATFORM : GOOGLE ADS

# THE MISSES

1. Generic Messaging: Several ads repeat similar phrases without strong USPs (e.g., speed, reliability, or cost savings).
2. Limited CTA Variation: Most ads lean on standard CTAs (“Learn More,” “Contact Us”) instead of more compelling action-driven prompts.
3. Sparse Localization: References to Europe or general regions are mentioned, but deeper local context (e.g., language, local shipping challenges) is minimal.
4. Potential Overlap/Fatigue: Ads look similar in structure and wording, risking repetition in search results.

# THE HITS

1. Varied Ad Formats: Mix of video ads (play icons visible) and static image ads provides diverse touchpoints and can capture attention in different ways.
2. Strong Brand Identity: Purple color scheme, FedEx logo, and consistent brand style across ads build immediate recognition.
3. Clear CTAs: Buttons like “Get Offer” or “Open a business account” are concise and action-focused, guiding users toward the next step.
4. Human Element: Several ads include human faces, which can boost relatability and trust—especially effective in B2B contexts.
5. Business-Focused Messaging: Copy such as “See what FedEx can do for your business” directly addresses potential customers’ needs, indicating a clear target audience.

# FEDEX COMPETITOR ADS ANALYSIS

# PLATFORM : META

# THE MISSES

1. Generic Copy: Phrases like “See what FedEx can do for your business” appear repeatedly; more specific value props (e.g., “Save on shipping,” “Get next-day delivery”) could differentiate FedEx from competitors.
2. Limited Visual Variety: Some ads use very similar layouts or stock-like images, risking ad fatigue if shown repeatedly to the same audience.
3. Underutilized Video Thumbnails: The video preview images are somewhat plain—stronger thumbnails (showing key benefits or a compelling visual) could entice more clicks.
4. Potential Lack of Localization/Personalization: Ads don’t appear to tailor messaging for specific industries or regions; more targeted copy (e.g., “Shipping solutions for small businesses”) could increase relevance.
5. CTA Consistency vs. Variety: While “Get Offer” or “Open a business account” is clear, testing alternative CTAs (“Start Shipping Today,” “Learn More,” “Request a Quote”) might improve conversions by aligning with user intent at different funnel stages.

# FEDEX COMPETITOR ADS ANALYSIS

# THE MISSES

1. Repetitive Messaging: Similar phrases (“Seamless Shipping,” “Ship & Save”) risk ad fatigue and lack deeper USPs.
2. Minimal Personalization: Ads rarely target specific industries or regions, missing tailored hooks.
3. Limited Emotional Appeal: Functional benefits dominate; intangible benefits (peace of mind, dedicated support) are underutilized.
4. Short/Vague Headlines: Some are too broad (“Your Shipping Solution”) and don’t differentiate FedEx.
5. One-Size-Fits-All CTAs: “Get a Quote” or “Ship Now” may not address earlier funnel users wanting “Learn More” or “Compare Options.”

# BACKGROUND STORY

MDSAP offers enterprise software solutions. They are SAP Gold Partners offering SAP consulting, data and process modelling, managed services, training and implementation services to large corporations in the UAE.

Without any prior SEO work, they needed a content marketing strategy to establish themselves as thought leaders in the industry and to improve their website performance and lead generation. To achieve this, we created informative content and focused on high-quality keywords. Our client rankings exceeded client expectations with massive increases in ranking, traffic, and leads driven by increased visibility in their core service pages as well as new blog articles created by the NEXA team.

# OBJECTIVES

- Rank targeted keywords in as short a time as possible and increase organic traffic.
- Create thought-leadership, informative and engaging content for the clients website, landing page and blog while improving SEO and website ranking.
- Reach a highly targeted UAE audience

# CHALLENGES

- No SEO activity was previously conducted.
- Competing mainly with high domain authority websites, including sap.com.
- Limited content creation.
- Difficulty in targeting keywords with high competition specific to the service/category.
- Slow organic traffic growth with only 20 targeted keywords.
- Cannibalization issue with multiple language URLs, e.g. English, Turkish and Polish landing pages ranking for the same keyword.

# SOLUTIONS

- Updating website pages to increase keyword density.

# BACKGROUND STORY

As a member of Ali & Sons in the UAE, Audi noticed a decline in sales for the Q3, Q5 and Q7 models. In order to generate more leads, NEXA launched a 2-month long advertising campaign to encourage potential buyers to schedule test drives, ultimately driving sales opportunities. As a result of these campaigns, there were over 2 million clicks and swipes and 254 qualified leads resulting in sales.

# RESULTS

|OBJECTIVES|2,169,728 clicks and swipes|
|---|---|
|Lead generation targeting a range of UAE residents ready to purchase any of the following Audi vehicles:|2 month campaign|
|Q3, Q5 and Q7 Sales ready leads required - test drive bookings classed as sales ready leads|15K+ landing page visits|
| |254 sales qualified leads|
| |$42 cost per qualified lead|

# CHALLENGES

- Demand for new vehicles declined in 2018 with less people ready to purchase brand new cars in preference for used vehicles.
- Client has never used digital-only campaigns previously but had noticed that traditional marketing was no longer creating the desired impact. Internal sales education was also required.

# SOLUTIONS

- Integration of sales lead data to the Audi's prospect / sales CRM.
- Workshop to educate the sales team about digitally generated leads and management of these.
- Social media campaigns across search, YouTube, Snapchat, Facebook & Instagram.
- Aggressive campaigns including demand generating retargeting messaging.
# BACKGROUND STORY

Rove Hotels, a joint venture between Meraas and Emaar Properties PJSC, offers modern and efficient hospitality for fast-paced urban lifestyles. With nine well-connected locations in Dubai, including Rove Downtown, Rove Healthcare City, Rove City Centre, Rove Trade Centre, and Rove Dubai Marina, the challenge was to reset the revenue and success of Rove Hotels after the Covid-19 pandemic. NEXA was tasked with creating a search marketing strategy despite cautious travelers and strong competition from online travel agencies. Price sensitivity was also an issue.

# OBJECTIVES

- Improve the current number of keywords ranking in top 10 - Both branded and non branded. Our goal was to have 900 keywords on the first page of Google SERPs in 12 months
- Increase the search impressions and clicks generated from blog posts in order to drive more organic traffic to the site
- Increase overall clicks and impressions of the website
- Increase overall search visibility for the Rove Hotels website

# RESULTS

|60%|Increase of Visibility for target keywords within the first 6 Months|
|---|---|
|95%|Increase in keywords ranking on the first page of Google|
|411,217|Total organic sessions|
|$5.1 Million|Total organic revenue generated|
|8,933|Unique purchases|

# CHALLENGES

- Difficulty in achieving top ranking for location-based keywords
- Traffic to the website was low and unqualified
- Other local hotels and the large, international Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) had already established a strong SEO presence over the years and the competition was palpable
- Covid-19 negatively impacted the business which caused them massive loss in revenue

# SOLUTIONS

- The team included targeted locations in the content of the website pages
- User experience was dramatically improved by analysing over 600 hours of user sessions recordings and heatmap analysis that allowed us to understand specific user actions and helped us to identify areas of improvement.
- As the target audience is a global audience, we investigated opportunities from other Search engines and put a plan in place to rank on those too, targeted potential keywords which had high search volume and were not at all ranking.
# BACKGROUND STORY

Al Ghurair is a real estate company that covers a variety of properties in Dubai across areas including Barsha and Deira. The real estate company offers mid to premium real estate offerings directly from the developer, and this is a unique service offering in the industry.

NEXA was tasked with creating lead generation campaigns to increase rentals, and we launched these campaigns across social media and search engines while also exposing the company to newer platforms.

We ran SnapChat, TikTok and YouTube campaigns to help reach new audiences and gain more tenants from these spaces. In order to better the campaign performance in a highly competitive industry, the NEXA team would meet once a week to adjust the campaign accordingly, testing different key visuals to increase campaign performance, promoting different properties with a variety of apartment size and bidding high on related keywords.

# RESULTS

|---|---|
|857|leads achieved in three months|

# OBJECTIVES

Lead generation to increase property rentals.

# CHALLENGES

- Promoting different properties with a variety of apartment sizes.

- Testing various channels.
# BACKGROUND STORY

Allianz Travel offers international travel insurance. One of its greatest lead generation challenges is the highly competitive industry. Allianz Travel partnered with NEXA to overcome this and increase UAE-targeted online purchases of various travel insurance products, including Schengen, Global, UAE Inbound Product, Annual Multi-trip, and Haj & Umrah. NEXA worked on Google search for the company and created bidding to target cost-per-action, a Google Smart Bidding strategy, which sets bids to increase conversions at or below the target cost-per-action.

NEXA then placed bidding on high search volume keywords, optimising campaigns using negative keywords and creating ad assets based on the targeted keywords. The goal was to build audiences based on the target market and by using best-practice landing pages we achieved a high site-conversion rate.

# RESULTS

|AED 95K|spend|
|---|---|
|1,670|online insurance purchases|
|AED 443.41K|total conversion value|
|366%|ROI|
|12.10%|plus conversion rate|

# OBJECTIVES

Increase UAE-targeted online purchase of various travel insurance products like Schengen, Global, UAE Inbound Product, Annual Multi-trip, and Haj & Umrah.

# CHALLENGES

- Overly competitive market with a variety of options available at different rates.
- The restriction of travel during Covid-19 impacted the search terms (decrease in search volume/interest).
- Limited budget resulting in limited ad campaigns.

# SOLUTIONS

- Changing bidding to target cost-per-action (Google Smart Bidding strategy) which sets bids to increase conversions at or below the target cost-per-action.
- Bidding on high search volume keywords.
- Optimising campaigns using negative keywords.
- Creating ad assets based on the targeted keywords.
- Building audiences based on target market.
- Using best practice landing pages to aid high site-visit-conversion rate.
