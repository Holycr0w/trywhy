PROJECT BRIEF
# Project Brief

AL Ghurair Foods is looking to launch a targeted digital marketing campaign for their brand, Jenan, to enhance brand awareness, increase product visibility across multiple categories (including eggs and flour), and drive website traffic. Additionally, they aim to maximize engagement with their audience while optimizing ROI on advertising spend.

In today’s saturated digital environment, successful campaigns must cut through the noise with precisely relevant and engaging content that resonates with the target audience. With an increasingly competitive market, it is critical for Jenan to differentiate itself as the go-to brand for quality food products through a strategic, data-driven digital marketing approach.

Websites (via advertising banners), social media feeds, and search engines are crowded with promotional content. To combat advertising fatigue, Jenan requires campaigns that not only attract attention but also create an emotional connection with the audience, fostering trust and long-term brand loyalty. This involves targeted messaging, compelling visuals, and strong calls to action that speak directly to Jenan’s customer segments.

As performance marketing specialists, we bring extensive expertise in crafting innovative and effective digital marketing strategies. By employing industry best practices, leveraging data insights, and focusing on measurable results, we are confident in our ability to build impactful campaigns that align with Jenan’s goals. Through the following sections, we will outline our proposed strategy, processes, and performance measurement framework to achieve the desired outcomes.

OUR APPROACH
The way consumers make purchasing decisions has evolved dramatically in recent years, influenced by digital platforms, increased connectivity, and shifting consumer behaviors. Today’s audience not only seeks convenience but also actively engages with brands through online platforms to research, evaluate, and make informed decisions.

For Jenan, this evolution creates an opportunity to connect meaningfully with its audience across multiple touchpoints and position itself as the trusted choice for premium flour, oats, eggs, and cooking oil.

Our strategy focuses on a 3-step approach: Awareness, Engagement, and Traffic, each designed to cater to distinct stages of the consumer journey. By delivering targeted and visually compelling campaigns, we will guide Jenan’s audience through each stage, building trust, inspiring interaction, and driving meaningful results.

To ensure a successful campaign, we will consider the following key factors throughout the process:

- Where does the target audience spend most of their time online?
- What type of content are they likely to engage with during the awareness stage?
- How can we ensure Jenan stands out among competitors and remains top-of-mind?
- What factors influence the final decision?

CASE STUDIES
# BACKGROUND STORY

As a member of Ali & Sons in the UAE, Audi noticed a decline in sales for the Q3, Q5 and Q7 models. In order to generate more leads, NEXA launched a 2-month long advertising campaign to encourage potential buyers to schedule test drives, ultimately driving sales opportunities. As a result of these campaigns, there were over 2 million clicks and swipes and 254 qualified leads resulting in sales.

# RESULTS

|OBJECTIVES|2,169,728 clicks and swipes|
|---|---|
|Lead generation targeting a range of UAE residents ready to purchase any of the following Audi vehicles:|2 month campaign|
|Q3, Q5 and Q7 Sales ready leads required - test drive bookings classed as sales ready leads|15K+ landing page visits|
| |254 sales qualified leads|
| |$42 cost per qualified lead|

# CHALLENGES

- Demand for new vehicles declined in 2018 with less people ready to purchase brand new cars in preference for used vehicles.
- Client has never used digital-only campaigns previously but had noticed that traditional marketing was no longer creating the desired impact. Internal sales education was also required.

# SOLUTIONS

- Integration of sales lead data to the Audi's prospect / sales CRM.
- Workshop to educate the sales team about digitally generated leads and management of these.
- Social media campaigns across search, YouTube, Snapchat, Facebook & Instagram.
- Aggressive campaigns including demand generating retargeting messaging.
# BACKGROUND STORY

Rove Hotels, a joint venture between Meraas and Emaar Properties PJSC, offers modern and efficient hospitality for fast-paced urban lifestyles. With nine well-connected locations in Dubai, including Rove Downtown, Rove Healthcare City, Rove City Centre, Rove Trade Centre, and Rove Dubai Marina, the challenge was to reset the revenue and success of Rove Hotels after the Covid-19 pandemic. NEXA was tasked with creating a search marketing strategy despite cautious travelers and strong competition from online travel agencies. Price sensitivity was also an issue.

# OBJECTIVES

- Improve the current number of keywords ranking in top 10 - Both branded and non-branded. Our goal was to have 900 keywords on the first page of Google SERPs in 12 months.
- Increase the search impressions and clicks generated from blog posts in order to drive more organic traffic to the site.
- Increase overall clicks and impressions of the website.
- Increase overall search visibility for the Rove Hotels website.

# RESULTS

|60%|Increase of Visibility for target keywords within the first 6 Months|
|---|---|
|95%|Increase in keywords ranking on the first page of Google|
|411,217|Total organic sessions|
|$5.1 Million|Total organic revenue generated|
|8,933|Unique purchases|

# CHALLENGES

- Difficulty in achieving top ranking for location-based keywords.
- Traffic to the website was low and unqualified.
- Other local hotels and the large, international Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) had already established a strong SEO presence over the years and the competition was palpable.
- Covid-19 negatively impacted the business which caused them massive loss in revenue.

# SOLUTIONS

- The team included targeted locations in the content of the website pages.
- User experience was dramatically improved by analysing over 600 hours of user sessions recordings and heatmap analysis that allowed us to understand specific user actions and helped us to identify areas of improvement.
- As the target audience is a global audience, we investigated opportunities from other Search engines and put a plan in place to rank on those too, targeted potential keywords which had high search volume and were not at all ranking.
# BACKGROUND STORY

Al Ghurair is a real estate company that covers a variety of properties in Dubai across areas including Barsha and Deira. The real estate company offers mid to premium real estate offerings directly from the developer, and this is a unique service offering in the industry.

NEXA was tasked with creating lead generation campaigns to increase rentals, and we launched these campaigns across social media and search engines while also exposing the company to newer platforms.

We ran SnapChat, TikTok and YouTube campaigns to help reach new audiences and gain more tenants from these spaces. In order to better the campaign performance in a highly competitive industry, the NEXA team would meet once a week to adjust the campaign accordingly, testing different key visuals to increase campaign performance, promoting different properties with a variety of apartment size and bidding high on related keywords.

# RESULTS

|11.6 million|impressions|
|---|---|
|857|leads achieved in three months|
|6,800|booking actions generated|

# OBJECTIVES

Lead generation to increase property rentals.

# CHALLENGES

Very high competition from other property finders and real estate developers.

# SOLUTIONS

- Promoting different key messages to increase audience interest.
- Testing different key visuals to increase campaign performance.
- Promoting different properties with a variety of apartment sizes.
- Bidding high on related keywords.
- Testing various channels.
# BACKGROUND STORY

Allianz Travel offers international travel insurance. One of its greatest lead generation challenges is the highly competitive industry. Allianz Travel partnered with NEXA to overcome this and increase UAE-targeted online purchases of various travel insurance products, including Schengen, Global, UAE Inbound Product, Annual Multi-trip, and Haj & Umrah. NEXA worked on Google search for the company and created bidding to target cost-per-action, a Google Smart Bidding strategy, which sets bids to increase conversions at or below the target cost-per-action.

NEXA then placed bidding on high search volume keywords, optimising campaigns using negative keywords and creating ad assets based on the targeted keywords. The goal was to build audiences based on the target market and by using best-practice landing pages we achieved a high site-conversion rate.

# RESULTS

|AED 95K|spend|
|---|---|
|1,670|online insurance purchases|
|AED 443.41K|total conversion value|
|366%|ROI|
|12.10%|plus conversion rate|

# OBJECTIVES

Increase UAE-targeted online purchase of various travel insurance products like Schengen, Global, UAE Inbound Product, Annual Multi-trip, and Haj & Umrah.

# CHALLENGES

- Overly competitive market with a variety of options available at different rates.
- The restriction of travel during Covid-19 impacted the search terms (decrease in search volume/interest).
- Limited budget resulting in limited ad campaigns.

# SOLUTIONS

- Changing bidding to target cost-per-action (Google Smart Bidding strategy) which sets bids to increase conversions at or below the target cost-per-action.
- Bidding on high search volume keywords.
- Optimising campaigns using negative keywords.
- Creating ad assets based on the targeted keywords.
- Building audiences based on target market.
- Using best practice landing pages to aid high site-visit-conversion rate.
# BACKGROUND STORY

With the rise in popularity and usage of Online Travel Agency (OTA) websites such as Booking.com and Expedia, hotels are being forced to pay commissions on room bookings confirmed through the OTA channels. To drive greater direct, non-commissionable bookings, Nexa created and executed direct booking campaigns for Hilton Worldwide.

# OBJECTIVES

Promotion of a Seasonal campaign promotion for portfolio of GCC properties in 2018. The key objective was to generate website traffic at greater than average click through rates for the industry. Campaigns were run on Facebook, Instagram and various display and programmatic ad networks.

3 Month Campaign
102,872 Clicks Generated to Website
$0.10 Cost per Click to Website
$800,000+ Revenue Generated from Direct Bookings

# CHALLENGES

Each city's target audience was unique in online behaviour and preferences so multiple campaigns and demographic personalisation was required.

# SOLUTIONS

Localised creatives blending Hilton brand guidelines and promotion with target audience personality.
