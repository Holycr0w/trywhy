# THANK YOU

On behalf of the entire NEXA team, I'd like to thank you for considering our business and inviting NEXA to pitch and propose for the SOLUTIONS + website project.

Since our inception in 2005, our goal has always been to build a sustainable business that delivers products and services of the highest quality for our clients. This has remained true from our humble beginnings as a small, four-person web development agency to an award-winning growth agency today with almost 120 employees and offices in Dubai, New York, Melbourne, and Manchester. For a digital-focused business to remain relevant after almost 2 decades in operation speaks volumes about our commitment to learning and keeping our team at the forefront of the latest technology, tactics, and techniques.

Our employees support large organisations around the globe, providing a full suite of business growth services. The strength of our exceptional team allows us to create actionable and implementable digital growth strategies. These strategies and, more importantly, the net result of these have been recognised by industry peers during many regional awards celebrations.

Nexa is pleased to present this proposal to deliver a world-class digital platform for the 2026 Abu Dhabi Masters Games. Our approach combines innovative design, robust technology, and strategic functionality to achieve the event’s objectives of fostering global community engagement, boosting tourism, and enhancing Abu Dhabi’s reputation as a global sporting hub.

We're excited to be a part of this process. With this presentation, we hope to demonstrate why we are the best fit for your business and this project, by showcasing our approach, experience, and expertise.

Thanks again for this opportunity,

Amit Vyas

They are looking to design a high-performing, engaging website, and a digital strategy that reflects the event. With the design of the website, we will ensure that the calibre of your brand is reflected in a website that provides the best user experience to increase credibility and drive growth.

CASE
STUDIES
# CASE STUDY

# CLIENT: SHEIKH SAUD BIN SAQR AL QASIMI FOUNDATION FOR POLICY RESEARCH

# Website Design & Development

# SECTOR: SEMI-GOVERNMENTAL

The Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi Foundation for Policy Research was established in 2009 to aid the social, cultural, and economic development of Ras Al Khaimah, a northern Emirate in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the Al Qasimi Foundation and NEXA have developed a strong relationship over the years.

The initial engagement between the two was initiated when the Al Qasimi Foundation reached out to NEXA to create a website for the foundation. This site was developed using .NET, however as technology advanced and the foundation’s needs evolved, it became apparent that the site would need a technological overhaul.

NEXA was tasked to redevelop the website using the HubSpot platform which gave the Al Qasimi Foundation the ability to use a powerful CRM to manage their automation, workflows and sequences. This transformative technology has significantly enhanced the foundation's goals by providing them with valuable insights into their target audience and applicants.

Through HubSpot's data collection, lead management and departmental alignment capabilities the foundation is now able to streamline all their efforts and drive greater results.
# CASE STUDY

CLIENT: The Saudi Institute Of Internal Auditors

Website Design & Development

SECTOR: SEMI-GOVERNMENTAL

# Conference

The Saudi Institute of Internal Auditors is part of the global internal audit organization and the only official internal audit source in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. As such, IIA-KSA sets the bar for professionalism and knowledge sharing about internal auditing processes.

NEXA was tasked with creating their brand new website, with a brief that included strict guidelines and requirements regarding the information that needed to be displayed. The website was a custom design built using Umbraco, with various dashboards to suit all members and integrations such as Payfort for online payments, QuickBooks online for invoicing, and Aramex for shipping. All members, board members, the CEO, and the president considered the website a resounding success when it launched.

It was praised for its design and its technological build, providing much-needed features and functionality that the semi-governmental entity was previously lacking.
