YOUR BRIEF
# You want an agency to help you:

1. Enhance Dubai Humanitarian’s digital presence and audience engagement through bilingual (Arabic & English) social media content, while ensuring alignment with its mission and values.
2. Comprehensive social media management, including strategy development, content creation, community engagement, paid campaign execution, and crisis management.

# WHY SOCIAL MEDIA MATTERS FOR YOU
# The Role of Social Media For You

1. Global Awareness & Reach: Social media extends your visibility beyond traditional channels, ensuring its initiatives, emergency responses, and humanitarian efforts reach global audiences, partners, and donors in real time.
2. Engagement & Community Building: It fosters direct interaction with supporters, stakeholders, and beneficiaries, building trust through transparent communication, storytelling, and responsive engagement.
3. Crisis Communication & Rapid Response: During humanitarian emergencies, social media serves as a critical tool for real-time updates, mobilizing resources, coordinating relief efforts, and countering misinformation.
4. Advocacy & Fundraising: By leveraging compelling content, social media can drive awareness campaigns, inspire action, and encourage donations, partnerships, and volunteer participation to support humanitarian missions.
LET’S LOOK AT TRENDS WITH AN ANALYSIS
# Escalating Humanitarian Needs Amidst Funding Shortfalls

# Recent Trends

Surging Demand: The United Nations projects that 305 million people will require humanitarian assistance in 2025, a significant increase driven by ongoing conflicts, climate crises, and economic instability. Source

Funding Gaps: Despite the growing need, funding commitments are dwindling. In 2024, only 46% of the UN's $49.6 billion aid appeal was met, leading to reduced aid operations and difficult prioritization decisions. Source
# Geopolitical Shifts Impacting Aid Dynamics

# Recent Policy Changes

Major donors like the United States and the United Kingdom have significantly cut foreign aid budgets. The U.S. has paused nearly all foreign aid programs, while the U.K. has reduced its overseas aid budget from 0.5% to 0.3% of GDP, reallocating funds to defense spending. Source / Source 2.

# Emerging Donors

As traditional Western aid recedes, countries like China are expanding their influence through increased humanitarian assistance, altering the global aid landscape. Source

# Secure AT HOME

# Strong ABROAD
# Technological Advancements Transforming Aid Delivery

# Recent Trends

Digital Integration: Humanitarian organizations are increasingly adopting technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and data analytics to enhance operational efficiency, improve transparency, and better target aid delivery.

Social Media Utilization: Platforms like TikTok and Instagram are being leveraged to raise awareness and funds, especially among younger demographics. Influencers and content creators play pivotal roles in mobilizing support for humanitarian causes.
# Rising Importance of Localization and Community

# Recent Engagement Trends

Local Partnerships: There's a growing emphasis on empowering local organizations and communities to lead humanitarian responses, ensuring that aid is culturally appropriate and more effectively addresses specific needs. Source

Community Trust: Building and maintaining trust within local communities is paramount, as misinformation and disinformation can undermine humanitarian efforts and endanger both aid workers and recipients. Source
