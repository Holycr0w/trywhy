# Global Appeal

RAK has become a top destination for ultra-high-net-worth individuals, attracting 6,700 millionaires in 2024, the highest globally. This influx has bolstered the luxury real estate market, with international buyers seeking prime properties in the city.

# BACKGROUND STORY

UK-based developer Berkeley Group approached NEXA for assistance in generating ultra-high-quality leads and sales prospects in the Middle East. Usually, Berkeley would have a third-party broker sell on their behalf, but they found that the companies they usually worked with were refusing to take on certain developments in the less desirable parts of the UK. As a result, the developer took matters into their own hands and tasked us to help develop a solution. As their team were not sales agents or marketers, NEXA set up a system that nurtured leads to a point where they were considered hot and ensured the delivery of investors who were ready to purchase a unit. All the Berkeley team would need to do is close the deal. Our plan proved to be successful with the first development, and Berkeley requested NEXA to carry out work on other projects. Ultimately, Berkeley is now on its way to offering an end-to-end service with a fully-trained team and without any need for a third-party broker.

CLIENT: Berkeley Group

SECTOR: B2C - REAL ESTATE

# OBJECTIVES

Generate leads and sales prospects based in the Middle East for ongoing UK developments.

# CHALLENGES

- Overly competitive market with a variety of options available to prospects.
- The restriction of travel during Covid-19 impacted the ability of prospects being able to physically visit the developments in the UK.

# SOLUTIONS

- Automating content delivery to aid the identification of the most qualified prospects to streamline sales efforts and attention.
- Testing creative options and platforms from a campaign perspective to ensure that campaigns had the best chance of success from a lead conversion perspective.
- Optimising landing pages and journeys to ensure a high site visit conversion rate.

# RESULTS

60% conversion from marketing-qualified lead to sales-qualified lead

70% conversion from sales-qualified lead to opportunities

£2.24 million in revenue

20,482% return on initial investment

# SECTOR: B2C - REAL ESTATE

# BACKGROUND STORY

With the overly competitive market in the property sector and the restrictions on UK travel, our team implemented distinct messaging and noteworthy creative assets that complimented the campaign from the careful initial mapping of the customer journey.

Regular communication with the client ensured real-time feedback that allowed us to cross-check the data visible on the various platforms utilized.

Consistent optimization was implemented throughout this campaign, including the expansion of the target audience, amended creatives, and upgrading the site to suit an enhanced customer journey. Additionally, new campaigns were launched for the individual residential areas, with a retargeting campaign creating a sense of urgency among conflicted prospects.

# OBJECTIVES

Generate leads and sales prospects based in the Middle East for ongoing UK-based developments. The ultimate goal was to provide the client with a measurable return on investment that bettered their bottom line and helped them flourish in an unpredictable and worrisome period.

# RESULTS

60% conversion from sales qualified lead to opportunities

2% conversion rate from target keywords on Google ad campaigns

Sales of multiple units across a number of different projects / developments with a value of £1.8 million

# CHALLENGES

- Covid-19 took an enormous toll on the real-estate industry due to travel restrictions. When it comes to purchasing property, in-person visits have always been mandatory. We were tasked with finding creative solutions that would entice the target audience to take immediate action.
- The developments we were tasked to work on were Bankside Gardens and Green Park Village. Before NEXA took on the campaigns, Green Park Village was selling relatively well based on its location and design. Bankside Gardens was struggling in the economic crisis that accompanied the Covid-19 pandemic. As we had proven ourselves previously to the client, we were trusted to improve sales on both developments with a primary focus on improving sales for Bankside Gardens.
- Overly competitive and over-saturated markets presented a challenge as prospects had a plethora of options to explore when purchasing real estate in the UK.

# SOLUTIONS

- Building landing pages based on customer journey.
- Creating ad assets, highlighting key points of each project.
- Building audiences based on target markets.
- Creating marketing emails to help nurture from marketing qualified leads (MQL) to sales qualified leads (SQL).

NEXA used a total ad spend of USD 26,850, with the total confirmed revenue generated of more than USD 500k. This alone produced an ROI of 1,762%. Based on confirmation by Savills, a total of 22 SQLs and 377 MQLs remain active and in conversation.
# CASE STUDY

# Performance Marketing

# BACKGROUND STORY

Renowned property broker JLL approached NEXA for assistance in generating high-quality leads and sales prospects in the Middle East who were looking to invest in luxury UK property. The main aim of this campaign was to target high-net-worth investors who could afford the premium price point, as well as establish a highly qualified database of potential investors in the Middle East for current and future projects.

NEXA developed a digital marketing strategy for the property, No. 1 Palace Street, which included a landing page, nurturing emails, and ad sets. There was a specific focus on messaging and target audience as we aimed to attract the upper echelon in the region. The NEXA team supported marketing communications for the new developments advertised, as well as ensuring the utmost support during sales qualifications and marketing, and sales handover.

As a result, JLL was delivered only to the most qualified, “hottest” leads who were ready to purchase. The sales agents simply needed to close the deal.

CLIENT: MENA 2021

SECTOR: B2C - REAL ESTATE SEARCHAWARDS WINNER

# OBJECTIVES

Generate marketing-qualified leads based in the Middle East looking to invest in premium price point and luxury UK property.

# CHALLENGES

- At the time of the campaign, No. 1 Palace Street was a premium high-end, off-plan development, which limited the addressable market/target audience to extremely HNWI.
- The restriction of travel during Covid-19 meant that potential buyers could not visit the property itself and relied on virtual viewings.

# SOLUTIONS

- Identifying the most qualified prospects via automated content and lead scoring which ensured the sales team focused only on the most qualified leads.
- Sourcing data and using LinkedIn as a targeting platform to ensure that targeting of the HNWI required for the development.
- Creating assets and a landing page that spoke to the designated audience from a visual and messaging perspective, bearing in mind they would be most likely 'time-poor'.

# RESULTS

|20%|conversion from marketing-qualified lead to sales-qualified lead|
|---|---|
|40%|conversion from sales-qualified lead to opportunities|
|23%|email click rate of marketing-qualified leads|

# BACKGROUND STORY

UK-based broker, One Global, approached NEXA for assistance in generating high-quality leads and sales prospects in the Middle East and South Africa who were looking to invest in UK property. Noting our success with companies such as JLL and CBRE, One Global wanted to achieve the same positive results, as well as establish a highly qualified database of potential investors in the Middle East for current and future projects.

NEXA developed a digital marketing strategy for the One Global developments, which included a landing page, nurturing emails, and ad sets. The NEXA team supported marketing communications for the new developments advertised and ensured strictly consistent support during sales qualifications and marketing, and sales handover.

As a result, One Global was delivered only to the most qualified, “hottest” leads, who were ready to purchase. The sales agents simply needed to close the deal.

When we partnered with NEXA, we expected a 6 month campaign that would help us try to reach our goals. However, NEXA managed to exceed all our expectations and delivered exceptional results in just 4 months.

The team made everything feel effortless, even when it was certainly a stressful campaign. We look forward to partnering with NEXA in the future as new developments roll out.
