# PROJECT BRIEF
# Objective

To streamline SEWA's scholarship application process by developing a bilingual, fully digitized platform that integrates UAE Pass, provides real-time tracking, automated notifications, and an intuitive user experience.

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop an intuitive, efficient, and scalable scholarship platform that meets SEWA’s objectives while enhancing the user experience for students. By automating the scholarship process, the platform will improve operational efficiency, reduce administrative overhead, and create a transparent system for students to track their applications. The goal is to simplify the scholarship journey for students, empower the SEWA scholarship committee, and provide insights into platform performance.

# Key Features

- Bilingual support (Arabic & English)
- Secure login with UAE Pass integration
- Online application submission and tracking
- Notification system (email, SMS, and web)
- Student and Admin portals
- University API integrations
- Advanced search and ticketing systems

# Success Metrics

- Increase in successful applications
- Reduction in manual errors
- Decrease in support tickets
- Improved engagement and accessibility
# Current System Limitations and Challenges

This section identifies the current system's limitations and challenges faced by users and SEWA staff. It highlights areas for improvement, such as limited follow-up capabilities, outdated communication methods, and manual processes that cause delays and errors. Solutions to mitigate these challenges are also outlined to ensure a smoother application experience.

# 1. Limited Follow-up Capabilities

Students currently lack access to real-time tracking and updates, leading to uncertainty about their application status.

# 2. Lack of Communication Channels

No digital communication channels for students to contact SEWA, resulting in frequent phone calls and physical visits.

# 3. Lengthy Application Process

Manual data entry and document verification lead to processing delays and errors.

# 4. Frequent Phone Follow-ups and Physical Visits

A time-consuming and inefficient way to handle queries and updates.

# 5. Outdated System Design

The current system lacks a modern UI/UX design and fails to meet accessibility standards.

# 6. No Dedicated Request System

Students do not have a centralized platform to submit, follow up, or manage support requests.

# Mitigation Plan

- Implement a user-friendly portal for real-time updates and status tracking.
- Integrate automated notifications to improve communication.
- Streamline workflows with digital forms and automated processes.
# RISKS

- Delays in UAE Pass Integration: If UAE Pass integration encounters technical difficulties or regulatory obstacles, it could delay the automated collection of student information, impacting the entire application process.
- University API Integration Issues: There may be unforeseen challenges with integrating the university APIs (UoS and AuS), such as inconsistent data or errors during integration, potentially delaying project completion.
- Resistance to Change: SEWA staff or students accustomed to the old system may be resistant to using the new platform, leading to slow adoption and usability issues.
- Integration Failures: The integration with external systems (e.g., university APIs) could face issues like missing data fields, inconsistent data structures, or authentication problems, delaying the project.

# ASSUMPTIONS

- Scholarship Guidelines: SEWA will provide complete scholarship guidelines and criteria before the development phase begins, ensuring that the platform reflects accurate requirements.
- Student Data Verification: Students will have valid email addresses and phone numbers for verification and notifications. SEWA assumes that most students will have a UAE Pass account for easy data entry.
- IT Team Support: SEWA’s IT team will handle domain and hosting setup, ensuring that the platform is hosted on secure, compliant infrastructure.
- University API Documentation: Universities will provide adequate documentation for their APIs, ensuring that integration for student validation works smoothly.
- Target Audience: The platform will be used by students with basic digital literacy and access to the internet, and will be designed for mobile use to ensure accessibility.

“Since NEXA has taken over the optimisation of the Rove Hotels website, we’ve not only seen an increase in qualified traffic but also an increase in conversions. The NEXA team also worked closely with our in-house team during the transition to a new website, which can often be a tricky exercise. Thanks to the team, the transition was incredibly smooth and within a few weeks, we noticed even higher search traffic coming onto the website. Overall, we find the team very responsive and senior management actively involved in the process.”

“Our journey with the NEXA team has been a memorable one. NEXA was able to map out an efficient and data-driven strategy that has resulted in great success acquiring admissions and ensuring a seamless process among our staff. Their work ethic has been one of sheer dedication as they went above and beyond to guarantee results and communicate with us throughout the process. We look forward to working with NEXA in the future.”
