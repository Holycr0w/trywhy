# THANK YOU

On behalf of the entire NEXA team, I'd like to thank you for considering our business and inviting NEXA to pitch and propose for the Solutions+ website project.

Since our inception in 2005, our goal has always been to build a sustainable business that delivers products and services of the highest quality for our clients. This has remained true from our humble beginnings as a small, four-person web development agency to an award-winning growth agency today with almost 120 employees and offices in Dubai, New York, Melbourne, and Manchester. For a digital-focused business to remain relevant after almost 2 decades in operation speaks volumes about our commitment to learning and keeping our team at the forefront of the latest technology, tactics, and techniques.

Our employees support large organisations around the globe, providing a full suite of business growth services. The strength of our exceptional team allows us to create actionable and implementable digital growth strategies. These strategies and, more importantly, the net result of these have been recognised by industry peers during many regional awards celebrations.

We're excited to be a part of this process. With this presentation, we hope to demonstrate why we are the best fit for your business and this project, by showcasing our approach, experience, and expertise.

Thanks again for this opportunity,

Amit Vyas
CEO

# HUBSPOT CAN HELP WITH CHURN

For digital businesses, customer churn can be one of the biggest growth hindrances and processes must be employed to reduce the impact of this as much as possible. It's therefore vital to align your marketing, sales and customer service processes with customers at the heart of all activity to reduce friction and drive growth.

The models on this page highlight the need to keep customers as the focal point of commercial activity. The Flywheel on the left starts with campaigns/referrals at the 'Attract' stage, sales at the 'Engage' stage and finally operations/product usage and adoption at the 'Delight' stage.

The model on the right highlights the role played by each department in the customer satisfaction process with the ultimate goal to reduce customer churn, increase referrals and grow faster and more efficiently as a business. Remember, the last thing your business needs throughout its lifecycle is to reinvest more capital and resources into simply replacing lost customers.

# SEO - QUALIFIED TOP-MIDDLE OF FUNNEL TRAFFIC

SEO plays an integral role in the lead generation and conversion process and can influence overall success for a website.1

It's therefore important to understand the role that SEO plays in this process and by ensuring that your business is visible when your customers or prospects are searching for your offering, you'll be generating cost effective traffic that is more sustainable than paid advertising such as Google Adwords and Social Media traffic that provides a costly one-time visitor to your website.2

That's why we focus on creating click-worthy content as part of our approach and we'll explain more within this proposal.

|Organic Search Traffic|Marketing Qualified Leads|Sales Qualified Leads|

# OUR PROCESS - SEARCH ENGINE OWNERSHIP

As with many areas of digital marketing, SEO activities differ from agency to agency. Our process and methodologies have been perfected over 19 years of providing this service and our awards wins are a testament to our success and the success we create for our clients.

Here's our Managing Director, Andrew Thomas, to explain more about our approach:

# SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION

# 1 OPIMAHON 8

Researc word Keyv Searches

# MATION OD SEO
# THE TRUTH ABOUT SEO & OUTRANKING COMPETITORS

The ultimate goal of search engine optimization for a business is to rank higher on search engines such as Google than your competitors. It's that simple. What gets you there is less simple but can be summarised in 2 simple points:

1. The technical quality of your website.
2. The quality and volume of content contained within your website.

If you have a superior website from a technical perspective and have volumes of higher quality content than your competitors, you will outrank them.

If your website outranks competitor websites, the benefits are huge:

- You'll get more traffic to your website than they will.
- You build a tangible value to your business.
- SEO is an asset that has a value.
- You'll receive more conversions / leads.
# OUR APPROACH: SEARCH ENGINE OWNERSHIP MINDSET

It's important that you understand our approach to SEO. At NEXA, we believe that companies should have the objective of 'owning' the search engine results pages relevant to your business and have termed this philosophy "Search Engine Ownership".

This short video will explain the process in more detail:
# OUR APPROACH: SEARCH ENGINE OWNERSHIP MINDSET

When considering SEO for your business, you need to ask yourself whether you

|A|want your website to be optimized|
|---|---|
|B|if you want your business to own the|
| |search engines for searches relevant to|
| |your business|

If you’re looking for just (A), NEXA may not be the right agency for your business.

If you want your business to own search engine results pages, NEXA is the only agency for you and we want to embark on a Search Engine Ownership journey with your business.

Our approach focuses on 3 main areas - areas that are important for any business:

1. Your company's search visibility
2. Your search visibility in comparison to your competitors
3. The value of organic traffic in actual currency
# SEARCH ENGINE VISIBILITY

# What is Search Visibility?

If you've ever searched Google for a product or service that your business offers, just to see if your website ranks, what you are actually looking for is to see how visible your company is for that specific search.

Search Visibility is a metric that can be measured to see how visible your company is across every possible search term related to your business.
# THE PROCESS EXPLAINED

# 1. Immersion Session

One on one session with the organisation and the NEXA team to help understand the business better - objectives and goals

# 2. SEO and Keywords

Designing content with search engine in mind - adding keywords and potential topics to the list of searches to bring in traffic

# 3. Content Gap Analysis

Audit on the current content by the team and analysing the gaps and optimizing it with SEO team

# 4. Content Clusters

Creation of new content clusters, repurposed content and pillar pages focusing on specific keywords

# 5. Quarterly Plan

Creation of quarterly plan based on objectives - to include how to target the sector with already existing content and new content

# 6. Content Workshop

Explaining overarching content strategy, how we will use existing content and also create new content to reach our target market

# 7. Production

Developing new blogs, sharing repurposed content along with content suggestions - infographic, videos, animations, podcast etc

# 8. Reporting

Analysis to see what content is driving the most organic traffic which drives the content plan for month 3-6 in line with your goals
# THE PROJECT PLAN - 3 PHASE APPROACH

We recommend the following approach:

Launch an advanced audit with the outcomes focused on (a) identifying the technical improvements required on your website, (b) identifying your key competitors and understanding your true Search Visibility measurement, (c) identifying the content topics that will provide real impact for your business and (d) creating an implementation strategy for roll-out.

During this stage, we'll also identify the copy writing processes and tone of voice required of the content that will need to be created for your business.

# PHASE 1

MONTH 1

# PHASE 2

MONTHS 2 - 3

# PHASE 3

MONTHS 2 - 12

A continuous stream of ongoing SEO activity that includes frequent backlink audits and disavowing of rogue backlinks, additional backlink creation including Digital PR links, Wikipedia submissions and content creation & optimisation.

Throughout the engagement, our team will provide you with regular reports that focus on the key metrics of Search Engine Visibility, Volume of Traffic and the equivalent value of the traffic that we drive to your website through our activity.
# INITIAL TECHNICAL AUDIT / WEBSITE HEALTH CHECK

Our 19 point check list has been designed to ensure that your website is tested for every important aspect that can impact its position on Google. Post audit, our team will provide you and your development team with a list of recommendations that will need to be implemented. Our experts will support your development team throughout the process so that the implementation of our recommendations is smooth and efficient. If you’d prefer for our team to make the required changes to your website, we can provide an estimate of this once the audit is complete.

# WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON’T UPGRADE TO GA4?

Some potential consequences of not upgrading to GA4 include:

1. Limited Data migration: If you choose not to migrate to GA4, it will not be possible to transfer your data or download your reports from the older version of Google Analytics (Universal Analytics). Moreover, continuing to use Universal Analytics may pose a risk of losing all your data.
2. Limited data retention: Universal Analytics has a data retention limit of 26 months, which means that after that period, your data will be deleted. By not upgrading, you will lose valuable historical data after 26 months.
3. Missed opportunities: GA4 includes new features and integrations that can help you better understand your website or app's performance and user behavior. By not upgrading, you may miss out on valuable insights that could help you optimize your marketing strategies and improve user experiences.
4. Limited support: Google will phase out support for Universal Analytics, which means you may not receive updates or bug fixes in the future. This could lead to security vulnerabilities or other issues.
5. Incompatibility with new tools: As more tools and platforms integrate with GA4, you will encounter compatibility issues if you're still using Universal Analytics. This will limit your ability to take advantage of new marketing channels or technologies.

SECTOR: SEMI-GOVERNMENTAL

The Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi Foundation for Policy Research was established in 2009 to aid the social, cultural, and economic development of Ras Al Khaimah, a northern Emirate in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the Al Qasimi Foundation and NEXA have developed a strong relationship over the years.

The initial engagement between the two was initiated when the Al Qasimi Foundation reached out to NEXA to create a website for the foundation. This site was developed using .NET, however as technology advanced and the foundation’s needs evolved, it became apparent that the site would need a technological overhaul.

NEXA was tasked to redevelop the website using the HubSpot platform which gave the Al Qasimi Foundation the ability to use a powerful CRM to manage their automation, workflows and sequences. This transformative technology has significantly enhanced the foundation's goals by providing them with valuable insights into their target audience and applicants.

Through HubSpot's data collection, lead management and departmental alignment capabilities the foundation is now able to streamline all their efforts and drive greater results.
