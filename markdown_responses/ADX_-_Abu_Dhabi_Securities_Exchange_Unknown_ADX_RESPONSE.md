# LET’S LOOK AT MARKET TRENDS WITH A TREND ANALYSIS
# Surge in Gulf-Asia Trade

Trade between the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and Emerging Asia has seen a significant increase, rising by 34.7% from US$383 billion in 2021 to US$516 billion in 2022.

This growth is driven by higher average oil prices and substantial expansion in non-oil sectors, particularly technology and sustainability.

# Growth in Cross-Market Trading

# Market Trends

Financial markets are witnessing a shift towards cross-product execution, with trading desks engaging in multi-asset trading. This trend is evident in regions like Europe and is gaining traction in the Middle East, aligning with Tabadul's objective to facilitate cross-market trading.

# Middle East's Role in Global Trade

# Market Trends

The Middle East, Africa, and Asia are projected to drive global trade from $21 trillion to $32.6 trillion by 2030. The formation of regional economic blocs and increased intraregional trade are significant factors contributing to this growth.

# Integration of New Exchanges

Recent agreements indicate a trend of integrating additional exchanges into the Tabadul platform. For instance, the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange has signed agreements with the Iraqi Securities Commission to explore integrating the Iraq Stock Exchange (ISX) into the Tabadul Digital Exchange Hub.

# Growth in Cross-Border E-Commerce

# Market Trends

The Middle East's cross-border retail market is projected to expand by 25% annually over the next five years, reflecting a strong appetite for international brands and retail solutions. This growth in cross-border commerce can lead to increased demand for efficient cross-border payment and trading platforms like Tabadul.

The Middle East is experiencing rapid growth in real-time payments, with a 33.6% year-on-year increase in 2023, totaling 855 million transactions.

# Structured Testing for Optimisation

- The framework allows systematic testing of multiple variables (UGC hooks, USP hooks, targeting types) to identify what resonates best with the target audience.
- By segmenting campaigns into interest-based and CA/LA targeting, we can evaluate performance across different audience types, ensuring no opportunity is overlooked.

# Data-Driven Decision Making

- This method reduces risk and focuses investment on proven strategies.

# Why this Framework?

- Linear scaling ensures consistent growth while testing new versions of high-performing creatives keeps the campaigns fresh and relevant.

- It ensures that the strategy remains aligned with the platform’s dynamic and fast-paced platform environment.
# Improved ROI:

By focusing on the most cost-efficient ad sets and creatives, we maximise returns while minimising acquisition costs.

ADX ADS ANALYSIS
# INFORMATIONAL & CORPORATE-FOCUSED MESSAGING

- The ads focus on ADX’s financial performance, IPO proceeds, and yearly milestones.
- The short, formal text ("ADX End of year results are now available!") makes it clear but lacks a compelling hook to drive engagement.

# VIDEO FORMAT IS EFFECTIVE, BUT COULD BE MORE ENGAGING

- The video format is a strong choice, as it performs better than static ads for reach & engagement.
- However, the thumbnails lack high visual appeal—they mainly feature financial data without storytelling or human elements.

# LIMITED CTA APPEAL (ONLY "SEND MESSAGE")

- The CTA is limited to "Send Message", which might not drive high engagement.
- A stronger CTA like "Explore Key Highlights" or "See Full Report" could improve click-through rates.

# MULTI-PLATFORM APPROACH IS A STRENGTH

- The ads run on both Facebook & Instagram, ensuring broader reach.
- However, no LinkedIn presence? LinkedIn could be more effective for professional investors.

# MISSES & AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT :

- Lack of Emotional or FOMO Appeal: The ad doesn’t build excitement—adding "Record-breaking year" or "Key investment insights for 2025" could drive curiosity.
- No Social Proof or Engagement Elements: The ad lacks testimonials, investor insights, or shareable stats to encourage engagement.
- No Visual Contrast: The color scheme and visuals are corporate but not visually striking, reducing thumb-stopping power.

# Objective: Send Messages | Ad Type: Video ads | Ad Preview : Link Link
COMPETITOR ANALYSIS
# Active

# Library D: 969375931382829

# MULTI-PLATFORM REACH:

- The ad runs on Facebook, Instagram, and possibly Messenger & Audience Network, maximizing exposure across Meta’s ecosystem.
- Running multiple versions (6 ads with similar text and creatives) suggests A/B testing for optimization.

# STRONG INCENTIVE & CLEAR CTA:

- Offers a compelling reward (meet Pierre Gasly in Australia) to encourage registrations.
- The “Sign Up” CTA is clear and actionable, aligned with the campaign goal.

# ENGAGING VIDEO FORMAT:

- The ad uses a short-form video (22s), featuring a racing helmet—visually appealing for motorsport and Binance fans.
- Video content typically performs better in engagement compared to static images.

# PERSONALIZATION & URGENCY:

- Using a unique promo code “GASLYHELM” adds exclusivity and makes the offer feel limited-time or VIP-like.
- Time-sensitive incentive (event happening in March) pushes urgency.

# Active

# MULTI-PLATFORM DISTRIBUTION:

- The ad runs on Facebook, Instagram, and possibly Messenger & Audience Network, ensuring wide exposure.
- Multiple versions indicate A/B testing for optimization.

# STRONG FINANCIAL HOOK:

- 4% APY (Annual Percentage Yield) is prominently displayed, making it a compelling value proposition for users looking for better returns on idle cash.

# CLEAR & SIMPLE MESSAGING:

- The key details (APY, cost, terms) are transparent, reducing friction in decision-making.

# EYE-CATCHING CREATIVE & BRANDING:

- Bright neon yellow background immediately grabs attention.
- Minimalist design aligns with Robinhood’s brand identity—clean, modern, and finance-focused.

# COMPETITIVE PRICING AS THE CORE SELLING POINT

- The ads focus heavily on low interest rates for margin trading and high APY returns for investors.
- Direct comparison with competitors (e.g., E*TRADE at 14.2% vs. Robinhood at 6.75%) strengthens Robinhood’s cost-saving appeal.

# STRONG SOCIAL PROOF & TRUST SIGNALS

- Highlights 23 million investors, 3.1M+ 5-star app reviews, and FDIC/SIPC insurance to establish credibility.
- These elements reassure risk-conscious users, especially those hesitant about margin trading.

# MULTI-TIERED APPROACH FOR DIFFERENT AUDIENCES

- High-Yield Savings Ads target conservative investors looking for low-risk returns.
- Margin Trading Ads appeal to active traders focused on cost-efficient borrowing.
- Institutional Trust Signals (SIPC, FDIC) reinforce security for all user types.

# POTENTIAL AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

- Lack of Urgency: The ads could drive faster action with phrases like "Limited-time offer" or "Lowest rates—lock them in today!"
- Minimal Emotional Appeal: The messaging is data-driven, but adding real user testimonials or success stories could enhance engagement.

# Beehive Case Study

# BACKGROUND

Beehive, MENA’s first regulated and leading digital SME lending platform, faced a challenge: despite having a vast database of contacts within HubSpot, many of these leads had gone cold, leading to low re-engagement and conversion rates. The goal was to maximize the value of existing CRM data, rather than continuously investing in new lead generation.

To solve this, we introduced a performance-based, cost-per-lead (CPL) model, where Beehive only paid for leads that were successfully reactivated and brought back into the sales funnel. This strategy ensured that marketing efforts were results-driven, focusing on CRM optimization and conversion rather than just outreach.

The strategy involved cleaning and segmenting HubSpot data, identifying high-potential prospects, and designing automated email workflows, retargeting campaigns, and behavior-driven triggers to reignite engagement. Optimized landing pages with tailored content guided users back into the sales funnel, reinforcing Beehive’s value proposition.

This approach led to a significant increase in re-engagement, bringing previously inactive leads back into meaningful conversations with the sales team. The automation-driven workflows reduced manual effort, allowing teams to focus on high-intent prospects. The improved CRM structure and tracking enhanced lead visibility, transforming Beehive’s database from a passive repository into a high-performing revenue engine that consistently nurtures and converts leads.
