# WEBSITE TECHNOLOGY: WORDPRESS CMS

Probably the most popular platform for website design and development, WordPress websites account for over 22% of the world's websites. WordPress websites are perfect for companies that (a) have a very specific requirement; (b) need a fast turnaround and scalable website platform and (c) have limited complexity in terms of features and personalization of content.

# An overview:

- Websites can have either a custom design or an already-created template
- WordPress websites have few limitations from a technology, scalability, and feature perspective, with a vast array of plug-ins for almost every requirement
- WordPress is an open-sourced platform, so there will be limited IP in terms of site infrastructure if any at all
- Fast build and development time
- Easy integration into Marketing Automation and eCommerce platforms such as HubSpot and WooCommerce

# Server requirements:

A Linux Server will be required to host your WordPress website. NEXA can provide this in addition to website maintenance and warranty, including regular backups to protect your data.

# Websites that use WordPress:

The New Yorker, BBC America, Bloomberg Professional, The Official Star Wars Blog, Sony Music, TechCrunch, MTV News, Beyoncé, The Walt Disney Company, Time Inc., Facebook Newsroom, Microsoft News Center, and PlayStation Blog.

CLIENT: PALMA

Website Design & Development

SECTOR: HOLDING

Palmer Holding is a diversified conglomerate with a myriad of business divisions, including Palmer Communities, which focuses on property developments. The company, initially a family-run enterprise, has grown into an industry leader with global reach. However, their online presence had long been a bottleneck to their marketing and communications strategy; their previous website was cluttered, outdated, and lacked user-friendly design.

The website now serves as a one-stop-shop for all things Palmer, from corporate governance information for Palmer Holding to detailed showcases of ongoing projects by Palmer Communities. The success of this redesign has not only improved their customer interactions but has also paved the way for a series of other digital projects aimed at optimizing the firm's online ecosystem.

# CLIENT TESTIMONIAL - LIV MARINA

When we partnered with NEXA, we expected a 6 month campaign that would help us try to reach our goals. However, NEXA managed to exceed all our expectations and delivered exceptional results in just 4 months.

The team made everything feel effortless, even when it was certainly a stressful campaign. We look forward to partnering with NEXA in the future as new developments roll out.
