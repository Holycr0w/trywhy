OUR APPROACH
The way real estate investors and homebuyers make purchasing decisions has evolved significantly, influenced by digital platforms, increased connectivity, and shifting consumer behaviors. Today’s audience seeks more than just property listings; they engage with brands through online research, social validation, and immersive digital experiences before making a decision.

For Bloom Holding, this evolution presents an opportunity to connect meaningfully with potential buyers across multiple touchpoints, positioning itself as the trusted choice for premium real estate investments.

Our strategy follows a three-step approach:

# Awareness, Engagement, and Lead Generation

Each targeting a distinct stage of the consumer journey. By delivering targeted and compelling campaigns, we will guide potential investors through each stage, building trust, fostering engagement, and ultimately driving lead conversions.

To ensure a successful campaign, we will consider the following key factors throughout the process:

# Our Approach

- Where does our target audience spend most of their time online?
- What type of content will resonate most effectively at each stage of our funnel?
- How can we ensure Bloom Holding remains top-of-mind among competitors?

CASE STUDIES
# BACKGROUND STORY

With the overly competitive market in the property sector and the restrictions on UK travel, our team implemented distinct messaging and noteworthy creative assets that complimented the campaign from the careful initial mapping of the customer journey.

# RESULTS

Regular communication with the client ensured real-time feedback that allowed us to cross-check the data visible on the various platforms utilized.

60% conversion from sales qualified lead to opportunities

Consistent optimization was implemented throughout this campaign, including the expansion of the target audience, amended creatives, and upgrading the site to suit an enhanced customer journey. Additionally, new campaigns were launched for the individual residential areas, with a retargeting campaign creating a sense of urgency among conflicted prospects.

NEXA used a total ad spend of USD 26,850, with the total confirmed revenue generated of more than USD 500k. This alone produced an ROI of 1,762%. Based on confirmation by Savills, a total of 22 SQLs and 377 MQLs remain active and in conversation.

Sales of multiple units across a number of different projects / developments with a Value of £1.8 million

# OBJECTIVES

Generate leads and sales prospects based in the Middle East for ongoing UK-based developments. The ultimate goal was to provide the client with a measurable return on investment that bettered their bottom line and helped them flourish in an unpredictable and worrisome period.

# CHALLENGES

- Covid-19 took an enormous toll on the real-estate industry due to travel restrictions. When it comes to purchasing property, in-person visits have always been mandatory. We were tasked with finding creative solutions that would entice the target audience to take immediate action.
- The developments we were tasked to work on were Bankside Gardens and Green Park Village. Before NEXA took on the campaigns, Green Park Village was selling relatively well based on its location and design. Bankside Gardens was struggling in the economic crisis that accompanied the Covid-19 pandemic. As we had proven ourselves previously to the client, we were trusted to improve sales on both developments with a primary focus on improving sales for Bankside Gardens.
- Overly competitive and over-saturated markets presented a challenge as prospects had a plethora of options to explore when purchasing real estate in the UK.

# SOLUTIONS

- Building landing pages based on customer journey.
- Creating ad assets, highlighting key points of each project.
- Building audiences based on target markets.
- Creating marketing emails to help nurture from marketing qualified leads (MQL) to sales qualified leads (SQL).
# BACKGROUND STORY

UK-based broker, One Global, approached NEXA for assistance in generating high-quality leads and sales prospects in the Middle East and South Africa who were looking to invest in UK property. Noting our success with companies such as JLL and CBRE, One Global wanted to achieve the same positive results, as well as establish a highly qualified database of potential investors in the Middle East for current and future projects. NEXA developed a digital marketing strategy for the One Global developments, which included a landing page, nurturing emails, and ad sets.

# RESULTS

The NEXA team supported marketing communications for the new developments advertised and ensured strictly consistent support during sales qualifications and marketing, and sales handover. As a result, One Global was delivered only to the most qualified, “hottest” leads, who were ready to purchase. The sales agents simply needed to close the deal.

- Optimising keyword, social ads, and competitor analysis to ensure that ads served had optimal chances of peak performance across all platforms.

# BACKGROUND STORY

As a sales-focused real estate consultancy, JLL relies on lead generation to support its developer partners. JLL needed a team to generate leads and sales prospects based in the Middle East for ongoing UK-based developments. Having used other digital marketing agencies and invested directly with real estate portals, JLL became frustrated with the results of these campaigns and approached NEXA. JLL’s greatest challenge was the overly competitive market, offering a variety of options to prospects. Travel restrictions during Covid-19 also impacted in-person visits to the developments in the UK.

NEXA's approach with clients is driven by strategy rather than simply launching campaigns without data and RESULTS testing. NEXA's strategy consisted of building landing pages based on the customer journey, creating ad assets, highlighting key points, and building niche audiences based on the target market. Once prospects were 70% conversion from marketing qualified reached, personalized marketing emails were sent to nurture and convert them into sales-qualified leads. This lead to sales qualified lead strategy achieved immediate results and sales for JLL.

JLL now has £4.2 million in potential revenue since partnering with NEXA, and NEXA is the exclusive digital marketing partner for JLL in the Middle East. This work has extended to multiple high-profile UK developers.

# Case Study

# OBJECTIVES

Generate marketing-qualified leads based in the Middle East looking to invest in premium price point and luxury UK property.

# CHALLENGES

- At the time of the campaign, No. 1 Palace Street was a premium high-end, off-plan development, which limited the addressable market/target audience to extremely HNWI.
- The restriction of travel during Covid-19 meant that potential buyers could not visit the property itself and relied on virtual viewings.

# SOLUTIONS

- Identifying the most qualified prospects via automated content and lead scoring which ensured the sales team focused only on the most qualified leads.
- Sourcing data and using LinkedIn as a targeting platform to ensure that targeting of the HNWI required for the development.
- Creating assets and a landing page that spoke to the designated audience from a visual and messaging perspective, bearing in mind they would be most likely 'time-poor'.
# BACKGROUND STORY

Renowned property broker JLL approached NEXA for assistance in generating high-quality leads and sales prospects in the Middle East who were looking to invest in luxury UK property. The main aim of this campaign was to target high-net-worth investors who could afford the premium price point, as well as establish a highly qualified database of potential investors in the Middle East for current and future projects.

NEXA developed a digital marketing strategy for the property, No. 1 Palace Street, which included a landing page, nurturing emails, and ad sets. There was a specific focus on messaging and target audience as we aimed to attract the upper echelon in the region. The NEXA team supported marketing communications for the new developments advertised, as well as ensuring the utmost support during sales qualifications and marketing, and sales handover.

As a result, JLL was delivered only to the most qualified, “hottest” leads who were ready to purchase. The sales agents simply needed to close the deal.

# BACKGROUND STORY

UK-based developer Berkeley Group approached NEXA for assistance in generating ultra-high-quality leads and sales prospects in the Middle East. Usually, Berkeley would have a third-party broker sell on their behalf, but they found that the companies they usually worked with were refusing to take on certain developments in the less desirable parts of the UK. As a result, the developer took matters into their own hands and tasked us to help develop a solution.

# RESULTS

As their team were not sales agents or marketers, NEXA set up a system that nurtured leads to a point where they were considered hot and ensured the delivery of investors who were ready to purchase a unit. All the Berkeley team would need to do is close the deal.
