# FEATURED CASE STUDY

# IM Group

IM Group’s Challenge:

IM Group faced a significant challenge in the impending retirement of their BlueVenn CRM by March 2024. With a robust IT team and a technology environment centered around Microsoft, their initial inclinations leaned toward Dynamics for the transitional phase. Salesforce also emerged as a potential alternative. The enduring partnership between NEXA and one of their brands, Isuzu, played a pivotal role in sparking their interest in exploring our HubSpot services.

# Nexa’s Challenge:

Our challenge lay in navigating IM Group's intricate multi-brand and multi-territory automotive setup. The complexity of their use case demanded sophisticated solutions, including the intricate management of Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs), dealing with ownership by multiple contacts, and ensuring the segregation of information across diverse brands and territories. This multifaceted challenge required a tailored approach to ensure a seamless transition to HubSpot.
# FEATURED CASE STUDY

# IM Group

# Our Solution:

To tackle IM Group's intricate challenges and win over their initially sceptical team, we crafted a swift and strategic response:

1. Rapid Response Team: Recognising the presence of existing proposals from Microsoft and Salesforce, we rapidly assembled a dedicated team. This team comprised seasoned HubSpot sales experts, technical architects, implementation specialists, a project manager, a HubSpot solution engineer, and other skilled technical professionals. This collective effort ensured that we could swiftly address IM Group's unique requirements.
2. Comprehensive Demonstrations: We conducted an array of technical demonstrations, showcasing HubSpot's prowess in handling IM Group's specific automotive use cases. These demonstrations were the result of a close collaboration between Nexa and HubSpot, highlighting our commitment to delivering tailored solutions.
3. Proven Expertise: Despite our well-established history with IM Group's Isuzu brand, we understood the importance of proving our competence in automotive CRM solutions. To bolster our case, we provided a reference from another automotive client, Suzuki. This reference served as a testament to our expertise and track record of successfully executed projects within the automotive sector.
4. Detailed Use Cases: In our quest to provide IM Group with a clear understanding of how HubSpot could cater to their unique needs, we meticulously developed detailed use cases for each brand and territory. These were presented on our demo platform, showcasing HubSpot's adaptability and its ability to address IM's requirements.
5. Risk-Free Initial Phase: To alleviate concerns and provide reassurance, we initiated the project's initial phase under an understanding that allowed IM Group flexibility to cancel without cost if unsatisfied. This showcased our commitment to delivering results and earning their trust.
PROJECT BRIEF
# PROJECT BRIEF

# Nio CRM Project

# Overview

Nio Cars is a forward-thinking automotive brand with a growing presence in the market, focused on delivering a seamless customer experience across its sales, after-sales, and service operations. As Nio continues to expand, optimizing its customer relationship management (CRM) system is essential for ensuring efficiency, transparency, and improved engagement across all customer touchpoints.

NEXA proposes a comprehensive onboarding and implementation of HubSpot CRM, integrating Sales, Marketing, and Service Hubs to create a unified, data-driven system. This will streamline operations, enhance customer interactions, and provide real-time insights across departments. The solution will be designed to integrate with existing systems, ensuring seamless communication between platforms such as finance (SAP), inventory (DMS), and customer service tools.
# HUBSPOT IS BUILT DIFFERENTLY
# HUBSPOT ELEMENTS

HubSpot is a unified, scalable CRM platform designed for seamless collaboration across sales, marketing, service, content, and operations. Unlike traditional CRMs, it ensures effortless data flow between teams, enhancing efficiency and customer experience. Built as an all-in-one system, it eliminates silos and provides a single source of truth.

Additionally, HubSpot’s open APIs allow businesses to integrate with custom applications and third-party tools, ensuring flexibility, scalability, and a fully connected tech stack.

# CRM SPECIFICS

# FOR NIO
# HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW

The diagram below provides a high-level architecture of the systems and connections required for the CRM implementation, outlining the key integrations and data flow. The following slide will detail the communication processes and functional interactions between these systems.

|Customer Service| |SMS|Whatsapp| |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | |Call Center System| | |
|Inventory Management|Finance|HubSpot|SAP| |
|WMS|DMS|Diary Management|Diary Management| |
|MicroSoft 365 / Gmail|MicroSoft 365 / Gmail|Calendar|Email| |

# HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW

# 01 CRM (HubSpot)

HubSpot CRM will serve as the centralized platform, connecting all external systems and facilitating seamless operations across departments. The HubSpot Operations Hub will be utilized to enable custom code automation, webhooks, and API-based connections, ensuring data flows efficiently between systems. At the core of the implementation, HubSpot CRM will be structured around three primary hubs: Sales Hub for managing leads, deals, and sales processes; Marketing Hub for customer engagement, automation, and nurturing campaigns; and Service Hub for handling customer support and case tracking, ensuring all customer interactions are logged and accessible.

# 02 Customer Service

The Service Hub in HubSpot will be the primary interface for the customer service team, allowing them to manage customer inquiries, cases, and support workflows efficiently. The CRM will be integrated with Nio’s call center system, enabling customer service representatives to track, record, initiate, and receive calls directly from HubSpot. Additionally, integrations with WhatsApp and SMS platforms will provide the ability to send messages and manage customer communications within the CRM, ensuring all interactions are logged for a comprehensive view of each customer’s engagement history.
# HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW

# 03 Diary Management

The Sales and After-Sales Teams will leverage HubSpot Sales Hub to manage contacts, deals, tasks, and meeting scheduling. To ensure seamless coordination, HubSpot will be integrated with calendar and email clients, allowing for real-time syncing of appointments, follow-ups, and customer interactions. The assumed providers for this integration are Microsoft 365 or Gmail, ensuring that sales representatives can efficiently schedule and track their meetings within the CRM while maintaining accurate communication records.

# 04 Finance

A two-way sync between SAP (Finance Platform) and HubSpot will be implemented to ensure accurate financial data management and customer tracking. Whenever a new customer record is created in HubSpot, it will automatically sync with SAP, ensuring that financial systems have updated and complete customer information. Conversely, financial data such as invoices, payments, and credit history will be pushed from SAP back into HubSpot. This integration will enable automated customer communication triggers within HubSpot’s Marketing Hub, ensuring that finance-related notifications, payment reminders, and engagement campaigns are seamlessly managed.
# HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW

# 05 Inventory Management

A two-way sync between HubSpot CRM and the Dealer Management System (DMS) (to be defined by Nio) will be established to provide real-time inventory tracking. The DMS will push available vehicle models and stock levels into HubSpot, allowing the sales team to have immediate visibility into available options. When a vehicle is allocated to a customer, HubSpot will update the DMS to reflect the purchase, ensuring accurate inventory tracking and seamless coordination between sales and inventory teams.
# USERS

# CRM User Allocation & Further Clarifications

Nio has mentioned in the Q&A section of the RFP that they have 65 users in total. Based on our understanding, the following teams will be utilizing HubSpot CRM:

- Sales Team: 18 users
- After-Sales Team: 9 users
- Marketing Team: 6 users
- CRM Team: 2 users

Further clarification is required on the number of Customer Service team members, as they will also need dedicated seats in the CRM for case management, customer interactions, and support workflows. Understanding their exact team size and role-specific requirements will help us optimize licensing, permissions, and system configuration accordingly.
# ASSUMPTIONS / EXCLUSIONS

1. Cloud-Based CRM: The HubSpot CRM will function as a cloud-based SaaS platform, ensuring accessibility and scalability without the need for on-premise infrastructure.
2. WMS Integration with DMS: The Warehouse Management System (WMS) is already integrated into the existing Dealer Management System (DMS) and will not require separate integration with HubSpot.
3. Exclusion of Transportation & Freight Processes: The transportation and freight management processes are handled in a separate system and will not be included in this project’s integration scope. If required, this will be considered in a future project phase.
4. Cash Flow Management in SAP: Financial and cash flow management will continue to be managed within the existing SAP finance tool and will not be replicated within HubSpot.
5. Supplier Portal Development: The development of a supplier portal is not in scope for this project and will need to be considered as a separate initiative if required.
6. Bayzat: Integration with the HR Functionality is out of scope of this project.
