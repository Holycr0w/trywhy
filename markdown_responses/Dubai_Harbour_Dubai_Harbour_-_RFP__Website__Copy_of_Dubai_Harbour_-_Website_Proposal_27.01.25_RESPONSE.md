# WEBSITE TECHNOLOGY: WEBFLOW CMS

Webflow has emerged as one of the most innovative platforms for website design and development, offering a no-code solution that combines visual design with powerful functionality. Webflow websites are ideal for businesses that (a) need a highly customizable, visually engaging platform; (b) require fast deployment without sacrificing quality; and (c) want built-in flexibility for ongoing content updates and scalability.

# An Overview:

- Design Freedom: Webflow allows for completely custom designs, enabling creative teams to build unique, pixel-perfect websites without the constraints of pre-designed templates.
- Integrated CMS: A robust Content Management System (CMS) is built directly into the platform, simplifying the creation and management of dynamic content like blogs, case studies, or portfolios.
- No Plugins Needed: Unlike many platforms, Webflow has a native suite of tools, reducing reliance on third-party plugins for functionality, which ensures better security and fewer compatibility issues.
- Hosting and Performance: Webflow includes its own hosting powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Fastly, delivering exceptional performance and reliability.
- SEO-Ready: Webflow provides built-in tools for SEO optimization, such as customizable meta tags, clean HTML markup, and automatic SSL certificates, helping your site rank well on search engines.
- Integrations: Seamlessly integrates with marketing and analytics tools like Google Analytics, HubSpot, and Zapier to enhance functionality and track performance.
- User-Friendly Editor: Webflow’s intuitive Editor allows non-technical users to make content updates quickly and efficiently.

# Server Requirements:

With Webflow, hosting is included, eliminating the need for separate server management. Nexa can assist with the setup, ongoing website maintenance, and a warranty package that includes content updates, performance monitoring, and regular backups.

# Websites That Use Webflow:

Dell, Zendesk, Discord, Rakuten, Lattice, Hellosign, and many other forward-thinking companies leverage Webflow to

# SEO - QUALIFIED TOP-MIDDLE OF FUNNEL TRAFFIC

SEO plays an integral role in the lead generation and conversion process and can influence overall success for a website. It's therefore important to understand the role that SEO plays in this process and by ensuring that your business is visible when your customers or prospects are searching for your offering, you'll be generating cost effective traffic that is more sustainable than paid advertising such as Google Adwords and Social Media traffic that provides a costly one-time visitor to your website. That's why we focus on creating click-worthy content as part of our approach and we'll explain more within this proposal.

|Organic|Search Traffic|

# OUR PROCESS - SEARCH ENGINE OWNERSHIP

As with many areas of digital marketing, SEO activities differ from agency to agency. Our process and methodologies have been perfected over 19 years of providing this service and our awards wins are a testament to our success and the success we create for our clients.

Here's our Managing Director, Andrew Thomas, to explain more about our approach:

# SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION

# 1 OPIMAHON 8

Researc word Keyv Searches

# MATION OD SEO
# THE TRUTH ABOUT SEO & OUTRANKING COMPETITORS

The ultimate goal of search engine optimization for a business is to rank higher on search engines such as Google than your competitors. It's that simple. What gets you there is less simple but can be summarised in 2 simple points:

1. The technical quality of your website.
2. The quality and volume of content contained within your website.

If you have a superior website from a technical perspective and have volumes of higher quality content than your competitors, you will outrank them.

If your website outranks competitor websites, the benefits are huge:

- You'll get more traffic to your website than they will.
- You build a tangible value to your business.
- SEO is an asset that has a value.
- You'll receive more conversions / leads.
# OUR APPROACH: SEARCH ENGINE OWNERSHIP MINDSET

It's important that you understand our approach to SEO. At NEXA, we believe that companies should have the objective of 'owning' the search engine results pages relevant to your business and have termed this philosophy "Search Engine Ownership".

This short video will explain the process in more detail:
# OUR APPROACH: SEARCH ENGINE OWNERSHIP MINDSET

When considering SEO for your business, you need to ask yourself whether you

|A|want your website to be optimized|
|---|---|
|B|if you want your business to own the|
| |search engines for searches relevant to|
| |your business|

If you’re looking for just (A), NEXA may not be the right agency for your business.

If you want your business to own search engine results pages, NEXA is the only agency for you and we want to embark on a Search Engine Ownership journey with your business.

Our approach focuses on 3 main areas - areas that are important for any business:

1. Your company's search visibility
2. Your search visibility in comparison to your competitors
3. The value of organic traffic in actual currency
# SEARCH ENGINE VISIBILITY

# What is Search Visibility?

If you've ever searched Google for a product or service that your business offers, just to see if your website ranks, what you are actually looking for is to see how visible your company is for that specific search.

Search Visibility is a metric that can be measured to see how visible your company is across every possible search term related to your business.
# THE PROCESS EXPLAINED

# 1. Immersion Session

One on one session with the organisation and the NEXA team to help understand the business better - objectives and goals

# 2. SEO and Keywords

Designing content with search engine in mind - adding keywords and potential topics to the list of searches to bring in traffic

# 3. Content Gap Analysis

Audit on the current content by the team and analysing the gaps and optimizing it with SEO team

# 4. Content Clusters

Creation of new content clusters, repurposed content and pillar pages focusing on specific keywords

# 5. Quarterly Plan

Creation of quarterly plan based on objectives - to include how to target the sector with already existing content and new content

# 6. Content Workshop

Explaining overarching content strategy, how we will use existing content and also create new content to reach our target market

# 7. Production

Developing new blogs, sharing repurposed content along with content suggestions - infographic, videos, animations, podcast etc

# 8. Reporting

Analysis to see what content is driving the most organic traffic which drives the content plan for month 3-6 in line with your goals
# THE PROJECT PLAN - 3 PHASE APPROACH

We recommend the following approach:

Launch an advanced audit with the outcomes focused on (a) identifying the technical improvements required on your website, (b) identifying your key competitors and understanding your true Search Visibility measurement, (c) identifying the content topics that will provide real impact for your business and (d) creating an implementation strategy for roll-out.

During this stage, we'll also identify the copy writing processes and tone of voice required of the content that will need to be created for your business.

# PHASE 1

MONTH 1

# PHASE 2

MONTHS 2 - 3

# PHASE 3

# Gulf Craft

Gulf Craft is one of the world’s top seven shipyards, building ocean-going crafts within a strong network spanning Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and the Pacific.

NEXA was brought in to reevaluate the company's digital presence and subsequently, its internal operations. We proposed a streamlined sales, marketing and lead generation approach using HubSpot. To do this, we built a set of new websites for the main site and its subsidiary brands using the HubSpot CMS suite.

This shift resulted in transparent operations, enhanced online journey's for customers, and an improved ability to nurture relationships. By implementing lead generation based websites, Gulf Craft was able to drive its funnel approach.

Part of the Gulf Agency Company formed in 1956 the company expanded out of Sweden into Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Oman and Qatar. With several divisions within the organisation, NEXA was appointed to create a new website for their moving division.

NEXA created the website on the HubSpot platform, ensuring that a user from Oman would be able to view information that is relevant to Oman, including form fields, telephone numbers and addresses.

# CLIENT TESTIMONIAL - LIV MARINA

When we partnered with NEXA, we expected a 6 month campaign that would help us try to reach our goals. However, NEXA managed to exceed all our expectations and delivered exceptional results in just 4 months.

# CLIENT TESTIMONIAL - ROVE HOTELS

Since NEXA has taken over the optimization of the Rove Hotels website, we’ve not only seen an increase in qualified traffic but also an increase in conversions. The NEXA team also worked closely with our in-house team during the transition to a new website, which can often be a tricky exercise.

Thanks to the team, the transition was incredibly smooth and within a few weeks, we noticed even higher search traffic coming onto the website.

Overall we find the team very responsive and senior management actively involved in the process.
