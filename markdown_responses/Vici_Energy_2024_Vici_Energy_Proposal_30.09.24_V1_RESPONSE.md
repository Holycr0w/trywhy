# CASE STUDY

CLIENT: GLANDER

Website Design & Development

SECTOR: BUNKERING

INDUSTRIAL

Glander International Bunkering provides marine fuel and bunkering services to over a thousand vessel-owners worldwide.

NEXA was tasked with slowly updating each page of the website, with the aim of rebuilding the entire website. The site was very old and had been neglected - with outdated plugins, outdated core programming languages, and a lot of vulnerabilities.

This meant that NEXA was tasked with cleaning up the core elements of the site and upgrading its features to be in line with modern technology for websites. NEXA achieved this and provided additional support for creating new designs on most of the website.
# CASE STUDY

CLIENT: ALICO

Website Design & Development

SECTOR: INDUSTRIAL

The main objective was to showcase their projects to their customers. The website involved a custom development in design and a custom CMS built in WordPress.
