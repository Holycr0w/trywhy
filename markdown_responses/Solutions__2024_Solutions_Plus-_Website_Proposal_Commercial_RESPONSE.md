# THANK YOU

On behalf of the entire NEXA team, I'd like to thank you for considering our business and inviting NEXA to pitch and propose for the Solutions+ website project.

Since our inception in 2005, our goal has always been to build a sustainable business that delivers products and services of the highest quality for our clients. This has remained true from our humble beginnings as a small, four-person web development agency to an award-winning growth agency today with almost 120 employees and offices in Dubai, New York, Melbourne, and Manchester. For a digital-focused business to remain relevant after almost 2 decades in operation speaks volumes about our commitment to learning and keeping our team at the forefront of the latest technology, tactics, and techniques.

Our employees support large organisations around the globe, providing a full suite of business growth services. The strength of our exceptional team allows us to create actionable and implementable digital growth strategies. These strategies and, more importantly, the net result of these have been recognised by industry peers during many regional awards celebrations.

We're excited to be a part of this process. With this presentation, we hope to demonstrate why we are the best fit for your business and this project, by showcasing our approach, experience, and expertise.

Thanks again for this opportunity,

Amit Vyas
CEO
