# Case Study

# Dubai
# AUM

# AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF MALTA

When the American University of Malta (AUM) was established in 2016, it was presented as a highly anticipated addition to the local Maltese education market, expected to attract a large number of students. However, the university experienced delays and only opened its doors in 2019, which left a negative impression on the community. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic, which struck during the university's second year, made it difficult to attract international students. The university had to quickly adapt by moving its classes online to maintain continuity, but the pandemic's severe impact hindered any expansion plans.

# BACKGROUND

When the American University of Malta (AUM) approached Nexa in Q1 of 2022, we were tasked to help them increase sales at a contentious time for the university. We began working with the client in June 2022 and at that time, the university had only attracted 100 physical students on campus.

When NEXA took over the reins for marketing and lead generation, significant issues were flagged. We had noticed that the AUM marketing team had previously tried to generate potential students, and in doing so, overlooked 500 leads - despite the university having made large investments in technology such as Salesforce.
# Durham School Dubai

Durham Dubai is a branch campus of Durham UK, which is one of the oldest and most esteemed schools in the UK, with a history of academic excellence spanning six centuries. The institution benefits from the skills and expertise of its UK colleagues and those at its other international schools in Qatar and Kenya, making it a truly global organization with a broad outlook.

# BACKGROUND

Durham is one of the biggest institutions in the UK education sector. They launched in the UAE and tasked NEXA with running social media and ad campaigns focused on brand awareness, the rich history of Durham, and targeting parents with the aim to get them to visit the facilities. We successfully implemented social media and performance strategies for the school.

# COMMERCIAL PROPOSAL
Instead of charging a standard Retainer Fee linked to a fixed set of deliverables, we believe in using a Credit Based system that provides you with ultimate flexibility and control at all times.

# How it works:

- Prior to each month, our team will work with you to determine the activities that will be required (the deliverables).
- Each deliverable has an allocated number of Credits attached to it. For example, a blog article will be worth 2 Credits.
- The total credits can then be either pre-purchased or adjusted against any remaining credits from the previous month.
- If credits are unused, these carry over into the following month.
- Credits never expire, meaning that you will only ever pay for work that has been delivered.
# Traditional Retainer System

# Vs Credits

|Traditional Retainer|Credit System|
|---|---|
|Limited Flexibility month to month|Total Flexibility (each deliverable has a specified value)|
|Outstanding deliverables can be difficult to measure and manage|Credits are only spent when deliverables are completed. Until then, they remain in your Credit Bank|
|Downscaling and Upscaling services due to changing business needs can be difficult|Upscale and downscale with ease - just adjust the number of credits you need!|
