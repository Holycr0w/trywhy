# WEBSITE TECHNOLOGY: WORDPRESS CMS

Probably the most popular platform for website design and development, WordPress websites account for over 22% of the world's websites. WordPress websites are perfect for companies that (a) have a very specific requirement; (b) need a fast turnaround and scalable website platform and (c) have limited complexity in terms of features and personalization of content.

# An overview:

- Websites can have either a custom design or an already-created template
- WordPress websites have few limitations from a technology, scalability, and feature perspective, with a vast array of plug-ins for almost every requirement
- WordPress is an open-sourced platform, so there will be limited IP in terms of site infrastructure if any at all
- Fast build and development time
- Easy integration into Marketing Automation and eCommerce platforms such as HubSpot and WooCommerce

# Server requirements:

A Linux Server will be required to host your WordPress website. NEXA can provide this in addition to website maintenance and warranty, including regular backups to protect your data.

# Websites that use WordPress:

The New Yorker, BBC America, Bloomberg Professional, The Official Star Wars Blog, Sony Music, TechCrunch, MTV News, Beyoncé, The Walt Disney Company, Time Inc., Facebook Newsroom, Microsoft News Center, and PlayStation Blog.

# SEO - QUALIFIED TOP-MIDDLE OF FUNNEL TRAFFIC

SEO plays an integral role in the lead generation and conversion process and can influence overall success for a website.1

It's therefore important to understand the role that SEO plays in this process and by ensuring that your business is visible when your customers or prospects are searching for your offering, you'll be generating cost effective traffic that is more sustainable than paid advertising such as Google Adwords and Social Media traffic that provides a costly one-time visitor to your website.2

That's why we focus on creating click-worthy content as part of our approach and we'll explain more within this proposal.

# Organic Search Traffic

# OUR PROCESS - SEARCH ENGINE OWNERSHIP

As with many areas of digital marketing, SEO activities differ from agency to agency. Our process and methodologies have been perfected over 19 years of providing this service and our awards wins are a testament to our success and the success we create for our clients.

Here's our Managing Director, Andrew Thomas, to explain more about our approach:

# SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION

# 1 OPIMAHON 8

Researc word Keyv Searches

# MATION OD SEO
# THE TRUTH ABOUT SEO & OUTRANKING COMPETITORS

The ultimate goal of search engine optimization for a business is to rank higher on search engines such as Google than your competitors. It's that simple. What gets you there is less simple but can be summarised in 2 simple points:

1. The technical quality of your website.
2. The quality and volume of content contained within your website.

If you have a superior website from a technical perspective and have volumes of higher quality content than your competitors, you will outrank them.

If your website outranks competitor websites, the benefits are huge:

- You'll get more traffic to your website than they will.
- You build a tangible value to your business.
- SEO is an asset that has a value.
- You'll receive more conversions / leads.
# OUR APPROACH: SEARCH ENGINE OWNERSHIP MINDSET

It's important that you understand our approach to SEO. At NEXA, we believe that companies should have the objective of 'owning' the search engine results pages relevant to your business and have termed this philosophy "Search Engine Ownership".

This short video will explain the process in more detail:
# OUR APPROACH: SEARCH ENGINE OWNERSHIP MINDSET

When considering SEO for your business, you need to ask yourself whether you

|A|want your website to be optimized|
|---|---|
|B|if you want your business to own the|
| |search engines for searches relevant to|
| |your business|

If you’re looking for just (A), NEXA may not be the right agency for your business.

If you want your business to own search engine results pages, NEXA is the only agency for you and we want to embark on a Search Engine Ownership journey with your business.

Our approach focuses on 3 main areas - areas that are important for any business:

1. Your company's search visibility
2. Your search visibility in comparison to your competitors
3. The value of organic traffic in actual currency
# SEARCH ENGINE VISIBILITY

# What is Search Visibility?

If you've ever searched Google for a product or service that your business offers, just to see if your website ranks, what you are actually looking for is to see how visible your company is for that specific search.

Search Visibility is a metric that can be measured to see how visible your company is across every possible search term related to your business.
# THE PROCESS EXPLAINED

# 1. Immersion Session

One on one session with the organisation and the NEXA team to help understand the business better - objectives and goals

# 2. SEO and Keywords

Designing content with search engine in mind - adding keywords and potential topics to the list of searches to bring in traffic

# 3. Content Gap Analysis

Audit on the current content by the team and analysing the gaps and optimizing it with SEO team

# 4. Content Clusters

Creation of new content clusters, repurposed content and pillar pages focusing on specific keywords

# 5. Quarterly Plan

Creation of quarterly plan based on objectives - to include how to target the sector with already existing content and new content

# 6. Content Workshop

Explaining overarching content strategy, how we will use existing content and also create new content to reach our target market

# 7. Production

Developing new blogs, sharing repurposed content along with content suggestions - infographic, videos, animations, podcast etc

# 8. Reporting

Analysis to see what content is driving the most organic traffic which drives the content plan for month 3-6 in line with your goals
# THE PROJECT PLAN - 3 PHASE APPROACH

We recommend the following approach:

Launch an advanced audit with the outcomes focused on (a) identifying the technical improvements required on your website, (b) identifying your key competitors and understanding your true Search Visibility measurement, (c) identifying the content topics that will provide real impact for your business and (d) creating an implementation strategy for roll-out.

During this stage, we'll also identify the copy writing processes and tone of voice required of the content that will need to be created for your business.

# PHASE 1

MONTH 1

# PHASE 2

MONTHS 2 - 3

# PHASE 3

MONTHS 2 - 12

A continuous stream of ongoing SEO activity that includes frequent backlink audits and disavowing of rogue backlinks, additional backlink creation including Digital PR links, Wikipedia submissions and content creation & optimisation.

Throughout the engagement, our team will provide you with regular reports that focus on the key metrics of Search Engine Visibility, Volume of Traffic and the equivalent value of the traffic that we drive to your website through our activity.
# INITIAL TECHNICAL AUDIT / WEBSITE HEALTH CHECK

Our 19 point check list has been designed to ensure that your website is tested for every important aspect that can impact its position on Google. Post audit, our team will provide you and your development team with a list of recommendations that will need to be implemented. Our experts will support your development team throughout the process so that the implementation of our recommendations is smooth and efficient. If you’d prefer for our team to make the required changes to your website, we can provide an estimate of this once the audit is complete.

Since NEXA has taken over the optimization of the Rove Hotels website, we’ve not only seen an increase in qualified traffic but also an increase in conversions. The NEXA team also worked closely with our in-house team during the transition to a new website, which can often be a tricky exercise.
